    difficulty: 1,
    description: 'Generate income by selling call options on stocks you already own.',
    overview: `The Covered Call is Stanley's favorite strategy - it's like renting out a room in your house. You already own the stock (your house), and you sell someone the right to buy it from you at a higher price (renting the room). You collect premium (rent) while you wait.

This strategy is perfect for stocks you're willing to hold long-term but want to generate extra income from. It's called "covered" because you own the underlying shares - you're protected if the option gets exercised.`,
    keyPoints: [
      'You must own at least 100 shares of the underlying stock',
      'Sell a call option at a strike price above the current stock price',
      'Collect premium immediately as income',
      'Best used on stocks you\'re bullish or neutral on',
      'Your upside is capped at the strike price + premium received',
    ],
    riskProfile: 'Low risk - you already own the stock. Main "risk" is opportunity cost if stock rallies significantly past your strike.',
    maxProfit: 'Strike price - purchase price + premium received (capped)',
    maxLoss: 'Stock price going to $0 minus premium received (same as owning stock)',
    breakeven: 'Original stock purchase price - premium received',
    bestFor: 'Generating income on stocks you plan to hold long-term. Works well in sideways or slightly bullish markets.',
    avoidWhen: 'You expect a massive rally, or you\'re not willing to sell your shares at the strike price.',
    example: {
      scenario: 'You own 100 shares of Apple (AAPL) at $170 and want to generate income.',
      setup: 'Sell 1 AAPL call option with a $180 strike, expiring in 30 days, for $3.50 premium.',
      outcome: 'You immediately collect $350 (100 shares × $3.50). If AAPL stays below $180, you keep the premium and your shares. If AAPL goes above $180, your shares get called away at $180, and you profit $10/share + $3.50 premium = $1,350 total.',

    tips: [
      'Choose strike prices 5-10% above current price for balance of premium and upside',

    difficulty: 2,
    description: 'Get paid to wait for a stock you want to buy at a lower price.',
    overview: `The Cash-Secured Put is like putting in a lowball offer on a house AND getting paid for making the offer. You sell a put option, agreeing to buy the stock at a lower price if it drops. You collect premium while you wait.

You need enough cash in your account to buy 100 shares at the strike price (that's the "cash-secured" part). If the stock stays above your strike, you keep the premium free and clear. If it drops below, you buy shares at an effective discount.`,
    keyPoints: [
      'You must have cash to buy 100 shares at the strike price',

      setup: 'Sell 1 NVDA put with $420 strike, expiring in 30 days, for $8.00 premium.',
      outcome: 'You collect $800 immediately. If NVDA stays above $420, you keep $800. If NVDA drops to $420 or below, you buy 100 shares at $420 minus $8 = effective price of $412/share.',

    difficulty: 2,
    description: 'Buy insurance for your stock position to limit downside risk.',
    overview: `The Protective Put is pure portfolio insurance. You own stock and buy a put option to protect against a crash. It's like buying car insurance - you hope you never need it, but you sleep better knowing it's there.

This strategy costs money (the put premium), but it guarantees a floor on your losses. No matter how far the stock falls, you can always sell at the strike price.`,
    keyPoints: [
      'You own shares and buy a put option on the same stock',
      'The put gives you the right to sell at the strike price',
      'Your maximum loss is capped at: current price - strike price + premium paid',

    description: 'Combine covered call and protective put for near-zero-cost downside protection.',
    overview: `The Collar is Stanley's masterpiece of risk management. You own stock, buy a protective put (insurance), and sell a covered call (to pay for the insurance). The result? Limited downside, limited upside, and often zero net cost.

It's like trading some of your upside potential for downside protection. Perfect for locking in gains while staying invested.`,

    description: 'Collect maximum premium by betting on stocks staying put.',
    overview: `Stanley's Short Straddle is the ultimate "do nothing" trade. Sell both a call AND a put at the same strike. Collect premium from both sides. Then... take a nap. If the stock doesn't move much, you profit from both decaying to zero.

Warning: This has unlimited risk, but Stanley only uses it on boring, stable indexes. Slow and steady means... slow and steady.`,
